So here's what we need to do right now :
- Auth System
- DB Intialization
- Home page 
    - This for the projects page, where you see all of the projects you created and have a button to create a new project
- Create new project page 
    - takes the info like descreption and then creates your project 
- Project page
    - a page where you can post a devlog and see your project info and you can make it public or not too

This is what on my mind for now
